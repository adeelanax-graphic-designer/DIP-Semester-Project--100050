## Project Description
This project implements a traffic violation detection system using digital image processing techniques.  
Traffic video frames are analyzed to detect moving vehicles.  
A stop line is defined to identify rule violations.  
Detected violations are saved automatically for record and analysis.

---

## Objectives
- To understand the fundamentals of Digital Image Processing  
- To detect vehicles from traffic surveillance video  
- To identify traffic violations such as stop-line crossing  
- To store violation results for further analysis  

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- VS Code  
- GitHub

## Steps to Run the Code
1. Install Python (version 3.x)
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy


   Place the traffic video file in the project directory

Open terminal or command prompt

Navigate to the Code folder

Run the program:

python main.py


Output images will be saved in the Results/output_images folder
Dataset Information

This project uses a traffic surveillance video as the dataset.
Due to large file size, the dataset is not directly uploaded to the repository.
Dataset download instructions or sample images are provided in the Dataset folder.

Sample Input and Output

Input: Traffic video frames

Output:

Detected vehicles

Violation frames saved in the Results folder
The system successfully detects moving vehicles and identifies stop-line violations.
Violation frames are stored automatically for verification.
The results show that basic image processing techniques are effective for traffic monitoring.
