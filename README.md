## Project Description
This project implements a traffic violation detection system using digital image processing techniques.  
Traffic video frames are analyzed to detect moving vehicles.  
A stop line is defined to identify rule violations.  
Detected violations are saved automatically for record and analysis.

## Objectives
- To understand the fundamentals of Digital Image Processing  
- To detect vehicles from traffic surveillance video  
- To identify traffic violations such as stop-line crossing  
- To store violation results for further analysis
