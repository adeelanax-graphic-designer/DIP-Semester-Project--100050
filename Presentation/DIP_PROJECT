# Slide 2: Project Overview
- Implements a traffic violation detection system using digital image processing.
- Analyzes video frames from traffic surveillance.
- Defines stop lines to detect illegal crossing.
- Automatically records violations for analysis.

*Visual suggestion:* Diagram showing camera -> vehicle detection -> violation record.

---

# Slide 3: Objectives
- Understand fundamentals of Digital Image Processing.
- Detect moving vehicles from traffic videos.
- Identify traffic violations like stop-line crossing.
- Store violation results for further analysis.

*Visual suggestion:* Use icons for vehicle detection, analysis, stop-line.

---

# Slide 4: Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy
- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Version Control:** GitHub

*Visual suggestion:* Logos of Python, OpenCV, NumPy, VS Code.

# Slide 5: Methodology / Steps
1. Load traffic video using OpenCV.
2. Define stop line on the road.
3. Process each frame to detect moving vehicles.
4. Check if vehicles cross the stop line.
5. Record violation with timestamp and frame image.

*Visual suggestion:* Flowchart from video input -> detection -> violation -> output.

---

# Slide 6: How to Run the Code
1. Install Python (3.x)
2. Install libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
````

3. Run the main Python script.
4. Check output folder for detected violations and logs.

*Visual suggestion:* Screenshot of VS Code running the script.

---

# Slide 7: Demo / Output

* Sample frames with detected violations.
* Highlight vehicles crossing stop line.

*Visual suggestion:* Annotated screenshots or video snippet.

---

# Slide 8: Conclusion

* Traffic violations can be detected automatically using digital image processing.
* Helps in traffic monitoring and law enforcement.
* System can be extended for speed detection and license plate recognition.

---

# Slide 9: Future Work

* Integrate real-time live camera feed.
* Detect other violations like red-light crossing.
* Implement automatic fine generation and database storage.
